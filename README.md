# Cerebellar Loop

Update the paths in the ipynb to reflect the paths

 - `path_data`: must point to (initially empty) file store for storage of network, input, and simulation output
 - `path_code`: must point to the git repository

To run:

 - First, Run_Initializing.ipynb to generate a 'Seed', a frozen randomized network
 - Then edit Run.ipynb and run for simulation, eg. exp_run_range changes the simulation time
